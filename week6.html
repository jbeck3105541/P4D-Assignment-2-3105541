        <h2>Exercise Notes</h2>
        <p>Click 'Clear the Canvas' to start the game.</p>
        <p>Use arrow keys to move the box to where the 'X' is. When you reach the 'X', click Clear the Canvas to start a new game</p>
        <p>Tried creating a snake-like game. Would ideally like to have the game reset when the box reaches the 'X', and also wanted to change the Clear button to read 'Start Game' on page load.</p>
