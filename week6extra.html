        <h2>Exercise Notes</h2>
        <p>Rotate the shape by moving your mouse around the screen. Increase or decrease the number of sides the cylinder has by using the up and down arrow keys.</p>
        <p>For information, I was trying to add the number of sides as text so the user can see, though was unable to - from what I could find, text() has some issues when using WEBGL. Also tried to change the colour of the shape by using left/right arrow keys though had no success.</p>
